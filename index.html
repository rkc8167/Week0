        <h1>Raise the Red Lantern</h1>
        <h2>Interactive Performance</h2>
        <p>
            Raise the Red Lantern scrutinizes patriarchal dominance shown through a posthuman perspective. 
            This interactive performance examines the Meishan body as an inscribed vessel shaped by traditional 
            influences alongside surveillance mechanisms and silenced narratives. At her essence, Meishan 
            embodies an exquisitely dressed woman whose intrinsic beauty stands trapped within an unseen, 
            oppressive world. Ultimately, Raise the Red Lantern examines female empowerment and rebellion 
            across physical and digital realms. The work prompts questions about whether our contemporary 
            identities emerge from self-determination or simply another code written into the system.
